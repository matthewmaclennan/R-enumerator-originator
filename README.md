# R-enumerator-originator
#Enumerating acyclic originating molecules for a cyclic molecule
#Cyclic molecule is "decycled" until it is acyclic. The acyclic molecule is converted to InChI and stored.
#Which bond was broken is also stored.
#A list of InChI will be the unique list of acyclic originators for the cyclic molecules.
#A list of bonds broken will 
#A list of bond rankings for potential for being broken
#A list of the type of bond which was broken
